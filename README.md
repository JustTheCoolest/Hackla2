## Introduction

As environmental concerns grow, understanding and mitigating our carbon footprint becomes crucial. The Carbon Footprint Calculator provides a convenient way for users to estimate their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on two main factors: food consumption and transportation. By inputting data related to their diet and travel habits, users can gain insights into their impact on climate change and take steps towards more sustainable choices.

## Features
**Food Consumption Calculation:** The calculator takes input from the user regarding their food consumption patterns, including the type and quantity of different food items.

**CO2 Equivalent Calculation:** Based on the food consumption data, the calculator calculates the CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions produced due to the user's diet.

**Transportation Emissions:** The calculator also considers transportation as a significant contributor to carbon emissions. Users can provide information about their travel modes and distances to calculate their transportation-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

**Total Carbon Footprint:** By combining the food consumption and transportation emissions, the calculator provides an overall estimate of the user's carbon footprint.

**Awareness and Suggestions:** The calculator aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of individual actions. Additionally, it provides suggestions for reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices.
