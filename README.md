## Introduction

As environmental concerns grow, understanding and mitigating our carbon footprint becomes crucial. The Carbon Footprint Calculator provides a convenient way for users to estimate their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on two main factors: food consumption and transportation. By inputting data related to their diet and travel habits, users can gain insights into their impact on climate change and take steps towards more sustainable choices.

## Features
**Food Consumption Calculation:** The calculator takes input from the user regarding their food consumption patterns, including the type and quantity of different food items.

**CO2 Equivalent Calculation:** Based on the food consumption data, the calculator calculates the CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions produced due to the user's diet.

**Transportation Emissions:** The calculator also considers transportation as a significant contributor to carbon emissions. Users can provide information about their travel modes and distances to calculate their transportation-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

**Total Carbon Footprint:** By combining the food consumption and transportation emissions, the calculator provides an overall estimate of the user's carbon footprint.

**Awareness and Suggestions:** The calculator aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of individual actions. Additionally, it provides suggestions for reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices.

## Requirements
To use the Carbon Footprint Calculator, you need the following:

* Python (version 3.x)

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will be prompted to provide information about your food consumption habits, such as the types and quantities of different food items.
After entering your food consumption data, the calculator will ask for details regarding your transportation habits, including the mode of transport and distances traveled.
Once you have provided all the necessary information, the calculator will compute your carbon footprint by considering the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with your diet and transportation.
The calculator will display the results, including your total carbon footprint and suggestions for reducing emissions.
You can repeat the process to calculate the carbon footprint for different scenarios or make adjustments to your inputs.
